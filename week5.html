<h3>WEEK 5</h3> 

<p> March 1st </p>

<p>
  I decided that I wanted to make a little dinosaur buddy to accompany me in my studies on my desk!

I went about examining a tutorial for dinosaur printing on the internet and found a really good one by user Hendrien Horn on Youtube. The dinosaur's name is Alastair so I’ll be using that name from here on out.

</p>

<p>A lot of the steps included using features of fusion360 like the form setting and modifying there. I used a series of quadballs to create my general body/head shapes and stayed in the form setting. I used a lot of the delete feature to create holes/edges to extend outwards to create limbs, and generally used the edit form option pretty frequently adding in new faces and manipulating the shape of those faces to create the body parts in the way I wanted.

</p>


<p> There were difficulties along the way for sure. I got very frustrated during the whole design process because I still felt uncertain regarding my ability to use fusion360. I learned a few random things like when I need to select all of the edges before lengthening a form out, keyboard commands that make my life easier when I assemble something, and also generally just how to best orient my view on the plane while I’m in the midst of designing. </p>

<p>But when the design was done it was time to print! Ibrahim and Isa were very helpful during this process! Ibrahim gave me a really quick review of how to print something through fusion360 to Prusa and even reminded me what supports for our prints were. Due to the time constraint I felt like I was working with, I decided to take the safe route of including all the suggested support structures (even though Ibrahim said I might be able to risk losing a few support structures; I decided ultimately I was not feeling the desire to risk anything that night.) </p>
 

<p>When I started printing finally, the machine was acting funky! I asked Isa for help and she told me the printer was very angry at me and was jammed because of that. So she taught me how to fix those filament issues (basically checking/unjamming it by letting it melt down to the plate) and also how to change the filament with the printer settings! I felt like a pro afterwards.</p>

<p> Isa told me that moving to a different printer might be good so I did that. and then the 3 hour and 41 minute timer began!</p>

<p> March 2nd</p>

<p> I let the print happen overnight then went into the lab early this morning to get my dinosaur; someone had nicely set it aside for me! And after taking a few pics and snapping off the support structure, Alastair was finished!

      <p>I downloaded Polycam on my phone after talking to Abby about her success story in scanning an item with that app. It was really user friendly and I found that a lot of the functions were actually pretty intuitive. The program took lots of pictures of my dinosaur as I moved around it and it built a really cute and funny looking scan of the figurine for me. 

        It’s a bit incomplete but I now understand that the program just compiles the scan based on a lot of photos from me so if I took more then it’d be more complete. </p>
