<h3>WEEK 4</h3> 

<p> February 22nd </p>

<p>
  This project for me can be summarized into essentially me figuring out wires and understanding circuitry better as more wires are added to a breadboard/arduino. At various points of time, I was literally losing my mind over why my code (which looked fine) wasn’t working but in almost all cases, the code was actually fine! 
</p>

<p>Starting at the beginning, I knew that I wanted to make my ballerina motion-activated in some way. It turns out that someone else did that same thing and was able to inspire a lot of my initial code! Kalos’ knocking mechanism contraption was very similar to what I wanted to do and even used the same piezo disc! </p>


<p> First, I needed to test more complex code with a button. The button’s code worked out well! It was through this part of the coding that I started to really solidify what was a shaky understanding of Arduino code. I started to be able to read what was going on with the help of Geoff, Jackson, Isa, and Ibrahim (got lots of help!) In terms of the actual uploading of the coded actions to the breadboard, it wasn’t working at first but that was literally because Isa found that I needed one more wire added to my pile that grounded the circuit. </p>

<p>After successfully testing a button, I started testing the analog features of the piezo. I realized after looking at Kalos’ code that coding for machines is fairly simple. It really is just defining new components correctly, labelling where they sit on the board, and understanding the loop and if statements. 

  After a few typos here and there, the code was working! In terms of the circuitry, it seems essentially to be just a simple 5v path to a resistor back to ground. A lot of the complex elements come from the wires that provide data and information. </p>
