<h3>WEEK 6</h3> 

<p> Sometime in the first week of March </p>

<p>
  I feel like this week went by like a blur, I “finished” the capacitive portion of the assignment earlier last week with Abby and Geoff, by finishing up a sensor set-up that senses change in volume. So, I had originally put that portion aside for a while and continued to my other sensor. (But I shouldn’t have done that… long story short the capacitive sensor didn’t really catch any meaningful readings.) The video below is from earlier in the week.

<p>Putting that topic aside for a moment, the other sensor that I wanted to use was a hall sensor (at first). Kassia had mentioned that hall sensors are relatively easy to utilize. I didn’t realize at that moment that yes, it’s fairly easy to set-up, but I soon realized that the set-up alone was fairly easy to set, but the readings itself are actually quite finicky and weirdly sensitive? I think a challenge of this week is really understanding the calibration or the factors that make a sensor more or less sensitive.



<p> I then decided to change that sensor to a microphone instead. For this, Isa helped me during her office hours to set up a microphone sensor. I was finally able to get soldering checked off by her as I practiced soldering four rungs to each other. I think I did it pretty well! We can ask Isa. Then, connecting the wires to the Arduino was really a matter of looking at tutorials like the one provided on the website.</p>

<p>Snaps (measure 5 times and take average of the highest number)</p>

<p> 36, 37, 21, 23, 24 </p> 
  
<p>Claps </p>
<p> 76, 95, 158, 167, 190 </p>
<p> Volume of iPhone: </p>
<p>  Full iPhone Volume: 3, 4 </p>
<p> 3 clicks down: 3,2 </p>
<p>  3 more down (6): 2 </p>
<p> 3 more (9): 2,1 </p>
<p>  3 more (barely audible to me) (12 clicks): 1 </p>


<p>I wasn’t quite sure how the class wanted me to take readings so I just measured readings based off of a variety of different sounds. 

<p> March 9th</p>

<p> Fast forwarding now to March 9th, the day the assignment is due, I tried to work the capacitive sensor again by going to the classroom on my own. I was able to hook up everything and get readings, but for some reason that I wasn’t able to ascertain why the readings were so wonky! I will definitely have to take some time to figure out what’s going on at a later date. Maybe actually learn more about sensor calibration.
