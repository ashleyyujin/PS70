<h3>WEEK 2</h3> 

<p>On my first try with the machine, I was humbled by the laser cutter. I wanted to print a design, any design, on the last cutter so that I could start on my assignment and also become a bit more familiar with the machinery. After Kassia’s mini lecture, I was immediately confused so I started asking a lot of really dumb question about Fusion360 (enemy #1), asking what certain buttons did and how to most efficiently go about creating a shape. I decided to start really small and simple in order to apply what I learned about Fusion360 to a design that wouldn’t make me immediately lose my confidence, so I decided to make a rectangle shape with jut one notch to serve as some sort of base to my eventual assignment. 
</p>

<p>I was targeted by the laser cutter (going back to thex humbling incident) when everyone else’s designs were cut and then I decided to step up to the cutter to do my work, and then the air compressor decided to fight back. After waiting it out a bit, Bella and Abby told me that the machine was working again and my pieces were eventually cut out. Honestly, for a first try, the pieces fit each other pretty well. I started assembling my assignment at the same time as Bella which was another mistake of mine. I was forced to see just how much better Bella’s construction was in plain sight which was honestly just extremely comical to me. I shall endeavor to reach Bella’s level. This is a photo depicting our difference. </p>

<p>Wednesday, February 8th</p>

<p>I went to Nathan’s lab hours and started the process of completing my project. I think that it took a long time to really get comfortable with Fusion360 and also Inkscape. I had difficulties in downloading and opening the dxf file and also in scaling the file so that it would print itself correctly. Technology was fighting me back, but by 2pm I was able to have printed some semi-circle pieces with notches in them (thanks to Nathan and Connor; literally could not have done it without both of them) and I’m making some kind of a little figurine that has a lot of round features!</p>

<p>It was also this day that I went to Isa’s office hours and began an assembly of my two objects: both are components of a keychain that I have on my backpack all the time: a lego brick and its keyring. The lego was honestly fairly simple; it was really easy to measure and simple to conduct math to find out the right dimensions. Isa helped me gain footing around the usage of Fusion360 for assembly and also understand where to start.</p>

<p>The keyring process was a bit unsuccessful, especially when compared to the lego brick. I think that I’m able to grasp the general understanding of what I need to do to assemble a simpler item (like a lego which is essentially a box with repeating circles on it), but when more complicated functions like curves and layers come into play, I need more time studying Fusion360 functions to understand what I’m doing and what functions do which things to my model. After watching some tutorials for various functions in Fusion360 like how to make a line curved and how to look at various different layers of a sketch and learning about new functions, I was able to create a model of my keyring, but it’s pretty crude and inaccurate unfortunately. I think the basic idea might be there, but I just need to refine the assembly. Clicking around on Fusion360 was helpful in addressing some things though. I found that I can edit the way the pipe looks and made it rectangular in order to mimic the flat nature of my keyring. I think the main issues have to do with lengths and distances. There’s an issue of gap between the layers of the pipe. I also think some of the lengths of the keyring assembly are incorrect but I can’t seem to change them. I might know where I would have to fix the design though: I think earlier in the sketch part I probably should have accounted for certain distances when making my original circles that I patched and extruded. And in terms of the ends not meeting one another at the keyring latch part, I think there was a step where I could have extended the edges in the sketch that I didn’t do which effected the ability of the edges to meet.  </p>
