<h3>WEEK 3</h3> 

<p> February 10th </p>

<p>
  Today was my first real day of figuring out what my assignment is going to look like! I decided to go about making a twirling ballerina, reminiscent of a music box that I used to own when I was younger. I literally had zero idea of where to start so I went to PK’s office hours! They were really helpful in everything from concept explanation, idea development, and also visualization! I solidified a lot of my learning with them.
  
  I also was able to test the circuitry of my breadboard and found that it indeed was 5V worth of energy and I also tested my motor (fully functioning!)
  
  Then I started to work on my actual product. 
</p>

<p>After a while of neglecting my project for a bit, I finally was able to get to work on it using the diagram that I’d thought though with PK. The process ultimately became pre-“motor box” and post-“motor box” for me. I did a lot of thinking through of the box with PK. My first idea was to build a box with notches in it so that the sides fit nicely together. However, upon thinking through the notches and sides and dimension and width and subtracting that would go into executing this type of box, I thought against it considering my schedule for the week and tabled that for another assignment. I did however make a simple box and wood glued my sides together. </p>

<p> My box was completed, honestly, with little to re-do with the exception of one side of the box that was too small and didn’t meet the other edges. Then I drilled holes into the side of one box so the wires could neatly fit through and towards the breadboard and power everything. I quickly realized that forcing those wires at that proximity to the motor required pretty precise measurement of distancing between holes which I did not do. Ultimately, I created essentially a small and wide opening that doesn’t constrict the wires and allows for rather free movement which works pretty fine because the motor is held nicely in place by the box. </p>

<p>So! With a completed box, what was left really was making my ballerina and attaching her to the box. I decided to make an attachment first. I knew that everything had to be relatively small in scale because my box is only so big. So I took a discarded side piece from previously making the box and make that be the stand upon which my ballerina is glued upon now. After attaching the stand, I needed to make the ballerina!</p>

<p>At first I used silver wire but those are pretty thick, heavy, and hard to bend. I made one but for this box it wasn’t right. I then transitioned to a think black magnetic wire which was perfect! Easily bendable, thin and light, and the color was nice. 

  So I attached the wire sculpture to the motor and that was basically it! Spinning ballerina!</p>
