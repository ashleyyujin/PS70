    <h1>Idea #1</h1>
    <p>        
      I would like to build a interactive doorbell for my dorm that forces the guest to answer questions about my roommates and me. Mostly as a joke though! But I'd like the guest to test their J-21 knowledge before entering our room to sort of get them sweating and nervous in a funny-ish way! I'd like for the doorbell to seem like a regular doorbell until after they ring it and my voice starts guiding the guest through a series of questions about us four suitemates. I would like to be able to record reactions and sound effects that are linked to each answer choice and outcome and have those play out audibly throughout their time with the doorbell.

    <h1>Idea #2</h1>
    <p>
        I would like to build an automated "study buddy" dancing animatronic. I want it to be a combination of screen time deterrant and also motivational assistant. I'd like to connect it with my phone somehow so that it can tell when I pick my phone up for more than 3 minutes and can speak out a warning or tell me to put my phone down and continue working. More importantly though, I'd like for it to have the capacity to say different motivational phrases (or spin, or play funky music) at time checkpoints, maybe 20 minutes of uninterrupted studying, or and hour and so on. 
    </p>

    <h1>Idea #3</h1>
    <p>
      This idea is based off of an actual product I've seen online, but I would like to make something for my parents so that they have a physical notification of when I am free to be called by them. They've mentioned to me that they don't call me during college because they don't want to interrupt my classes/social time/extracurriculars and that always made me feel bad. So I'd like to give them some kind of a lit-up box that can shine when I activate it from Cambridge (meaning that I'm free for them to call me if they'd like). And if I'm not free, I can turn their box off so it's not lit and they know that I'm currently in classes, or a meeting, or dinner. Ideally, this could be controlled through some sort of handheld remote I carry around me or an app.
