  <h3>WEEK 10</h3> 

  <p>
    For this week, our team built a drawing machine that was essentially a larger replica of Nathan’s drawing machine. The concept was simple(?) enough and the goal was for the machine to spin around, and to be able to hold a pencil with its end effector. There was even a desire to make the device have a cheez-whiz drawing capacity… That eventually proved unable to complete though. 
  </p>

<p> For me, I was on the hardware team that completed work mostly together. There were a few really fun and productive work sessions in which I learned essentially that for hardware/assimilation work, it was most helpful for people to be on deck mentally and working to figure out how things get put together as a team. My work sessions were usually with Abigail, Cindy, and Jade. I really got to know them all pretty well and explored the materials sections of the lab pretty well. A lot of bolts/screws/nuts were required for the hardware of this machine and even a pulley system and lots of close examination of Nathan’s robot. I feel like we also filled in a lot of gaps for each other. Jade was extremely talented at creating Fusion360 models and laser cutting acrylic parts quickly, Abigail and Cindy seemed really knowledgable in how things were put into place and functioned in the big picture and I think I became pretty good at assembling parts fairly quickly and knowing how specific things were held up/where they went. </p>

<p>The actual presentation was pretty comical. Our machine…tried its best to perform. And to a degree it did draw (read: outline roughly) the circle that it was supposed to draw. The machine we quickly realized was quite big and moved really really slowly especially when powered with a limited voltage and moving two long pieces of aluminum with gadgets on it. The drawing was also quite messy partly due to the terrain that it was moving with (rough asphalt) I think further iterations of that machine would probably be smaller/lighter somehow or capable of handling more power, or would also have bigger wheels if it were operating in that same area outdoors. </p>

<p> Here is a gallery of photos from those work sessions!</p>
