<h3>WEEK 8</h3> 

<p>
  For this week’s assignment I decided to go with a simple heart mold that I hoped could become a cute little heart stamp eventually! 

The initial Fusion360 part of this assignment was definitely the most simple. It’s nice to see that my comfort level and skill level with Fusion is growing after what was slow going in the beginning of the semester and lots of personal frustrations at the software.

<p>But the CNC milling part was definitely the most challenging for me. The set-up was extremely clearly labeled on Nathan’s website but for some reason I just kept getting lost in the weeds of the computer program and the various buttons and I also lacked confidence on the machine because I didn’t know how to use it and I recalled the training for this week was a bit scary since these machines require a bit more focus and attention. </p> 

  <p>Thankfully, Nathan was there to help me with quite literally every step! I was able to upload my STL file pretty easily, but unit conversion and origin set-up with the SRM-20 (which is the milling machine I used) was all practically done with Nathan. (thank you again!)
  
  Then, I waited for the machine to finish drilling away the bits of wax that were around my heart stamp. There was a hilarious amount of wax shavings that accumulated throughout my shape. I think next time around I really should consider the depth of the actual drilling. I definitely didn’t need to shave off as much as my design ended up requiring and it’s really a simple fix that I could have accounted for in Fusion.

<p> The next steps were especially fun for me because I was able to really channel my childhood personas of “potion concoctor”/“chemist” as I poured mixtures into their respective molds. Mixing the two parts of rubber for the food-safe substance was fun and Nathan helped me find where the supplies were. Thankfully, there was just enough for me to use for my heart. The rubber mold took 4 hours to set and it went pretty well! </p>

<p>And then the next day, I went back into the lab to finally plaster cast the heart shape. That process went equally smoothly since the only instructions are to mix the plaster powder with water. At first, I was extremely confused because my mixture was extremely water-y, and then I reexamined the tub and noticed that I had switched the ratios of water and powder. (I needed wayyy more powder basically). That was pretty funny, and then I actually went about making my ooblek like plaster. After a pretty fast set time, the heart-shaped stamp item turned out really cute! </p>
